# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the **2024 Advent of Code** challenges.  
I‚Äôll be solving the puzzles using a variety of programming languages, including:

- Go
- Python
- C++
- C#
- Rust

**Note:** Not every puzzle will have solutions in all languages. Balancing time constraints and complexity may lead to some puzzles being skipped or solved in a limited set of languages.

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by programming language in the `src` directory.  
Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific language and contains solutions for the days completed in that language.

---

## üìú Input Data Policy

In compliance with the guidelines on the Advent of Code website, **input data is not included in this repository**. Input data is downloaded dynamically at runtime using a **Dagger Pipeline**, leveraging the session cookie provided to the `--session` argument.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Solutions Locally

### 1. Using Dagger

You can run solutions using **Dagger functions** with the following command:

```bash
dagger call run --lang=LANG --day=DAY
```

#### Input Data Handling
- **If input data is already available:**  
  Ensure the `inputs/` folder contains the input data for the day you are running. This folder will be uploaded to the Dagger Engine during execution.
- **If input data is missing:**  
  The pipeline will automatically fetch the input data from the Advent of Code website using your session cookie.

#### Storing Your Session Cookie
Save your Advent of Code session cookie in a file (e.g., `session.txt`) and run the following command to provide it to the pipeline:

```bash
dagger call --session=file:./session.txt
```

### 2. Using Local Development Tooling

You can also run solutions directly using the build tools of the respective programming language.

#### Example: Running Go Solutions
To run the Go solutions for a specific day, use the following commands:
```bash
cd src/go
go run main.go DAY < INPUT.txt
```

For other languages, use the appropriate build and execution commands as required for the language (e.g., Python‚Äôs `python3`, Rust‚Äôs `cargo`, etc.).
